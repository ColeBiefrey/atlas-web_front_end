These files are to assist me in learning how to handle and manipulate Cookies and related held data.

To run these files, make sure you have a basic webpack server installed, as it will not be pushed with the repo.
Once you have it set up you can use node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server in the shell to run a server to your localhost.
